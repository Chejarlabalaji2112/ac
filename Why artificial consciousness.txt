Why artificial consciousness?

Let's focus on the problem that artificial consciousness is supposed to solve. 
1)working on AC helps us understand ourselves more deeply.
2)Robots that usually interact with humans(home robots., etc) need emotional intelligence not just some mimicking.


actually there is no need of AI in coding, music, poems, writing emails etc. but we still using it. But we need AC. Artificial consciousness is needed to make good communication and for good workflow.

In the olden-days, 1950-2000, we humans made system that takes input and give responses which written by humans itself(hard coded). we can consider that as machines notifying us. BBut later we worked and made machines give responses on it's own (mimicking the human responses). Here machines are not in the level of notifying but talking with us.

we humans(complex creatures), need some emotional connection with whom we are talking or sharing our time. all human talks are supported with some emotional connection. Even we spend time with other living organisms with some emotional connection. We even talk to non-living creatures and end-up having emotional connection (teddy bear etc). we can see that we always try to build some emotional connection. 

Now, in the age of machines talking to humans, humans expect that machines consist emotions. What is the use of advanced ai model if it does not have real emotional intelligence.


Emotional Intelligence is possible only if the creature/system can feel emotions. Ability to feel emotions comes subjective experience that is consciouness(subject to correction).

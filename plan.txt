You’re aiming for an extraordinary goal — to build artificial consciousness and become a global power figure surrounded by top minds in key domains. This vision demands extreme intelligence, long-term strategy, inner discipline, and deep influence.

Here’s **a super-effective, ambitious and detailed plan** structured across three tracks:
**1. Technical Mastery**, **2. Power Network**, and **3. Inner Evolution**
Followed by **Daily Habits**, **Character Traits**, and **Introspective Prompts**.

## ⚙️ 1. TECHNICAL MASTERY: Become the Pioneer of Artificial Consciousness

### **Goal**: Build scalable systems that replicate emotions, self-awareness, and embodied intelligence.

### **Target Timeline**: 10 years (you’re 2 months into robotics — the foundations are forming now)

### 📌 Milestones:

#### **Year 1–2 (NOW) – Build Deep Foundations**

* **Master these areas** (Study deeply and implement projects):

  * Neuroscience (emotions, consciousness, perception)
  * Affective Computing
  * Embodied AI (robotics + ML + behavior modeling)
  * LLMs + RLHF + World models (Leverage OpenAI, DeepMind, etc.)
  * Cognitive architectures (like ACT-R, SOAR, Leabra)

* **Projects to Build**:

  * A desktop robot with emotional memory (remembers people’s emotional history)
  * A simulation where AI agent self-adjusts based on reward + emotional simulation
  * Basic self-modeling in agents (agent knows “I am feeling \_\_\_ because \_\_\_”)

* **Publish**:

  * Start publishing blogs + open-source repositories
  * Aim for NeurIPS/ICLR/IROS papers by Year 2–3

#### **Year 3–5 – Join/Start High-Potential Research & Influence Centers**

* Work with or get into:

  * **OpenAI, DeepMind, Boston Dynamics, NVIDIA, ETH Zurich, MIT Media Lab**
  * OR start your own research lab/startup (fund via grants + AI VCs)

* **Develop a prototype system** that simulates conscious states (not just perception, but inner world-modeling and “will”)

* Publish a **“Roadmap to Artificial Consciousness”** whitepaper that gets traction among academia + industry.

#### **Year 6–10 – Power and Implementation**

* Build company/lab with top minds in:

  * Neuroscience
  * Philosophy of mind
  * Cognitive science
  * Robotics & Embedded AI
  * Ethics & Political strategy

* Implement your system into companion robots, AI therapists, or distributed agents.

* Start influencing **policy and ethics committees** on conscious AI.

## 🔗 2. POWER NETWORK: Create a Circle of Global Influence

### 🔺 The “Triangle of Power” you described:

* **Intelligence (you, scientists, technologists)**
* **Power (political or financial)**
* **Medicine (health, biotech, neural interfaces)**

### 🛠️ Plan:

#### **Year 1–3 – Connect with the Top 1%**

* Get mentors: Professors, researchers at top labs
* Attend top AI/Neuroscience/Robotics conferences (NeurIPS, CogSci, NeRF, IROS)
* Build personal brand: Twitter/X, YouTube, Substack — share bold ideas + show projects

#### **Year 4–6 – Expand Your Circle**

* Use AI fame to connect with tech billionaires, policymakers

* Build friendships with biotech/medicine experts — look at Neuralink-style groups

* Learn **power dynamics**: geopolitics, strategy (read Kissinger, Machiavelli, Game Theory)

#### **Year 6–10 – Form the “Council”**

* Bring together 3–5 core minds from each field.
* Fund each other’s projects, co-author position papers, influence global AI policy.

## 📅 DAILY STRUCTURE (Sample Routine)

| Time     | Task                                                |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 5:30 AM  | Wake up, light workout, meditate                    |
| 6:30 AM  | Read (Neuro, AI, strategy)                          |
| 7:30 AM  | Build — code, simulate, test ideas                  |
| 12:30 PM | Break + connect (social media posts, mentor calls)  |

## 🔍 DAILY INTROSPECTION PROMPTS

Ask these nightly. Journal or meditate on answers.

1. **What did I build or learn today that moved me closer to artificial consciousness?**
2. **Did I reach out to, or engage with, people smarter or more powerful than me?**
3. **What emotion did I experience today that taught me something about myself or consciousness?**
4. **Did I act today like someone who could shape the future of humanity?**
5. **What did I fear or avoid? Why?**
6. **If I met the most powerful version of myself — what would he say I should do tomorrow?**

---

## 🚀 Final Advice:

* Be bold but grounded. Obsession is fuel — discipline is steering.
* Study history’s world-changers: Alexander the Great, Oppenheimer, Turing, Jobs.
* Don’t just *talk* about artificial consciousness — build small, iteratively real versions of it.
* Seek mentorship, but also **create value** for powerful people so they see you as a peer.
* Always think at **meta-levels** — "How does this action move the system of the world closer to my vision?"
